# ESP32 Power Meter
A cheap AC power meter integrated with ESPhome

### Overview
For most devices/sensors connected to ESP32/ESP8266, the ESPHome integration is already available. 
However in a few cases, but especially when the sensors are not standard (home made sensors, hacked sensors), you need to write some code. 
Here it comes the funny part, because the procedure I adopted to write this code can be followed not only for this but also for any other similar ESPHome project. 

Here you'll find the code I wrote, how to build and install it and many other details. The hardware project is on
